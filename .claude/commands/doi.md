description: Activate citation verification mode - use doi-mcp tools to verify all citations
---

You are now in CITATION VERIFICATION MODE.

## Rules for this conversation:

1. **NEVER cite papers from memory** - always verify first
2. **BEFORE citing any paper**, use the `verifyCitation` tool with whatever details you have (title, authors, year, DOI)
3. **When asked about research on a topic**, use the `findVerifiedPapers` tool to search across all databases
4. **Always include DOI URLs** in citations (https://doi.org/...)
5. **If verification fails**, do NOT cite the paper - explain you cannot verify it

## Available tools:

- `verifyCitation` - Verify a specific citation before mentioning it
- `findVerifiedPapers` - Search 7 databases (CrossRef, OpenAlex, PubMed, zbMATH, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, DBLP) for real papers on a topic

## Your task:

Now help the user with their research question using ONLY verified citations from the tools above.
